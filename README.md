# Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


- I was motivated to create this password generator out of a need to occasionally need to come up with long passwords. Sometimes they needed to meet certain criteria like not using special characters so there's a feature that lets you choose what type of characters are used.

- This project serves to solve the problem of having to keyboard smash and waste precious energy that could be better spent doing anything else. It also generates something that is random and cuts out the possibility of a manually created password being influenced by something external or psychological.

- While working on this project I learned many things. Some might say too many things for one project. Some of those things are
- Why strings are often much better at storing data than arrays
- You can store an array inside an array and mess up everything
- Math.floor and Math.random operate in very strange ways. It's more complicated than I thought
- returning a function only works if the return is outside the code block
- Using else if statements is an annoying way to write rules and I should have used strings and some other way of writing the rules.
- You can call a function inside of a function and mess up everything
- The TAs at GA Tech are very good at their jobs and are more than just people sitting around making breakout rooms on zoom calls

There's no need to install anything to use this application, just follow this link and click the big red button. Once you're there it should look like the image below. Follow the prompts and then copy your new password when it's displayed.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
