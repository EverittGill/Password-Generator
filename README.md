# Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


- I was motivated to create this password generator out of a need to occasionally need to come up with long passwords. Sometimes they needed to meet certain criteria like not using special characters so there's a feature that lets you choose what type of characters are used.

- This project serves to solve the problem of having to keyboard smash and waste precious energy that could be better spent doing anything else. It also generates something that is random and cuts out the possibility of a manually created password being influenced by something external or psychological.

- While working on this project I learned many things. Some might say too many things for one project. Some of those things are
- Why strings are often much better at storing data than arrays
- You can store an array inside an array and mess up everything
- Math.floor and Math.random operate in very strange ways. It's more complicated than I thought
- returning a function only works if the return is outside the code block
- Using else if statements is an annoying way to write rules and I should have used strings and some other way of writing the rules.
- You can call a function inside of a function and mess up everything
- The TAs at GA Tech are very good at their jobs and are more than just people sitting around making breakout rooms on zoom calls

## Usage

Smash that big red button and follow the prompts. Cancel equals "no" and OK equals "yes". Use them enough times and you will get a new password as a reward, so long as you want it to be between 8 and 128 characters.
